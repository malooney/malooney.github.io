I am a first year Ph.D. student in Department of Agricultural and Applied Economics at Texas Tech University. <br><br>
 
My main research interests are in the areas of microeconomic theory, game theory, and economic history. But I am also keenly interested in monetary theory, and public choice economics. Some rather broad topics that I'm sure I will focus as I move forward in my studies. <br><br>
  
I received a Bachelor of Science in Economics from The Pennsylvania State University in 2014.
